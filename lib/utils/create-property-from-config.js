/**
   * Creates effects for a property.
   *
   * Note, once a property has been set to
   * `readOnly`, `computed`, `reflectToAttribute`, or `notify`
   * these values may not be changed. For example, a subclass cannot
   * alter these settings. However, additional `observers` may be added
   * by subclasses.
   *
   * The info object should may contain property metadata as follows:
   *
   * * `type`: {function} type to which an attribute matching the property
   * is deserialized. Note the property is camel-cased from a dash-cased
   * attribute. For example, 'foo-bar' attribute is dersialized to a
   * property named 'fooBar'.
   *
   * * `readOnly`: {boolean} creates a readOnly property and
   * makes a private setter for the private of the form '_setFoo' for a
   * property 'foo',
   *
   * * `computed`: {string} creates a computed property. A computed property
   * also automatically is set to `readOnly: true`. The value is calculated
   * by running a method and arguments parsed from the given string. For
   * example 'compute(foo)' will compute a given property when the
   * 'foo' property changes by executing the 'compute' method. This method
   * must return the computed value.
   *
   * * `reflectToAttriute`: {boolean} If true, the property value is reflected
   * to an attribute of the same name. Note, the attribute is dash-cased
   * so a property named 'fooBar' is reflected as 'foo-bar'.
   *
   * * `notify`: {boolean} sends a non-bubbling notification event when
   * the property changes. For example, a property named 'foo' sends an
   * event named 'foo-changed' with `event.detail` set to the value of
   * the property.
   *
   * * observer: {string} name of a method that runs when the property
   * changes. The arguments of the method are (value, previousValue).
   *
   * Note: Users may want control over modifying property
   * effects via subclassing. For example, a user might want to make a
   * reflectToAttribute property not do so in a subclass. We've chosen to
   * disable this because it leads to additional complication.
   * For example, a readOnly effect generates a special setter. If a subclass
   * disables the effect, the setter would fail unexpectedly.
   * Based on feedback, we may want to try to make effects more malleable
   * and/or provide an advanced api for manipulating them.
   * Also consider adding warnings when an effect cannot be changed.
   *
   * @param {LittleBitElement} proto Element class prototype to add accessors
   *   and effects to
   * @param {string} name Name of the property.
   * @param {Object} info Info object from which to create property effects.
   * Supported keys:
   * @param {Object} allProps Flattened map of all properties defined in this
   *   element (including inherited properties)
   * @private
